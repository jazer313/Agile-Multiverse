# WHY
#WIP #Draft

people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.[^1]

a purpose, cause or belief that has nothing to do with WHAT they do

he WHY is offered as the reason to buy and the WHATS serve as the tangible proof of that belief.

A WHY is just a belief. That's all it is. HOWS are the actions you take to realize that belief. And WHATS are the results of those actions

A clear sense of WHY sets expectations. When we don't know an organization's WHY, we don't know what to expect, so we expect the minimum-price, quality, service, features-the commodity stuff.

With a WHY clearly stated in an organization, anyone within the organization can make a decision as clearly and as accurately as the founder. A WHY provides the clear filter for decision-making.

All organizations start with WHY, but only the great ones keep their WHY clear year after year. Those who forget WHY they were founded show up to the race every day to outdo someone else instead of to outdo themselves. The pursuit, for those who lose sight of WHY they are running the race, is for the medal or to beat someone else.
