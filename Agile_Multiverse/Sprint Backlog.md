# Sprint Backlog
#WIP 

The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the [[Developers (Scrum)]] [^1]. 

The Sprint Goal [[WHY]], the Product Backlog [[WHAT]] items selected for the Sprint, plus the plan for delivering them (The How) are together referred to as the [[Sprint Backlog]].

It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the [[Developers (Scrum)]] plan to accomplish during the [[Sprint]] in order to achieve the [[Sprint Goal]].

The Sprint Backlog is updated during the [[Sprint]] as more is learned. It should have enough detail that the [[Developers (Scrum)]] can inspect their progress in the [[Daily Scrum]].
