# Scrum
#WIP 

Scrum is a _lightweight framework_ first published in 1995. Developed by Ken Schwaber & Jeff Sutherland (Both co-authors of the [[Agile Manifesto]].

Scrum was founded on [[empiricism]] and [[lean thinking]].

When the [[Scrum values]] are *embodied* by the [[Scrum Team]] and the people they work with. Accompanied by the implementation of the [[Scrum pillar of transparency]],  [[Scrum pillar of inspection]] and [[Scrum pillar of adaptation]]; **trust** is built.

Scrum guides the relationships and interactions:
- A [[Scrum Master]] **fosters** the environment where...
- A [[Product Owner]] **orders** the work into a [[Product Backlog]].
- The [[Scrum Team]] turns a selection of the work into an [[Increment of value]] during a [[Sprint]].
- The [[Scrum Team]] and its [[stakeholders]] inspect the results and adjust for the next [[Sprint]].
