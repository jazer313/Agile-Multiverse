# Sprint Retrospective
#WIP 

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to _plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness_ for the next [[Sprint]].[^1]

The [[Scrum Team]] inspects how the last [[Sprint]] went with regards to:
- Individuals
- Interactions
- Processes
- Tools
- [[Definition of Done (Scrum)]]
- Any elements of their work

A _good_ retrospective should follow the [[Prime Directive]]

The [[Scrum Team]] discusses:
- What _went well_ during the [[Sprint]]
- What problems/impediments they encountered
- How those problems/impediments were (or were not) solved

There are [several group dynamics and games](https://www.funretrospectives.com) a team can use to run a Sprint retrospective.

_The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible_ and may even be added to the [[Sprint Backlog]] for the next [[Sprint]].

The Sprint Retrospective concludes the [[Sprint]]. It is [[time-box]] to a maximum of **three hours**.

The Sprint Retrospective is the materialization of the Agile Principle of [[At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly]]
