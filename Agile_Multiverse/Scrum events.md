# Scrum events
#practice 

Events happen during the duration of the [[Sprint]][^1].

They create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings[^2]; create opportunities to inspect and adapt ([[Scrum pillar of adaptation]]), and are designed to enable transparency ([[Scrum pillar of transparency]]).

The events in Scrum are:
- [[Sprint]]
- [[Sprint Planning]]
- [[Daily Scrum]]
- [[Sprint Review]]
- [[Sprint Retrospective]]
