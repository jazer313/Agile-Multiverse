# Prime Directive
#WIP 

The purpose of the _Prime Directive_ is to assure that a retrospective has the **right culture to make it a positive and result oriented event** [^1] (See: [[Psychological safety]]).

It makes a retrospectives become an effective space to learn and find solutions to improve the way of working, instead of a finger pointing and catharsis event.

  
> **"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."**
