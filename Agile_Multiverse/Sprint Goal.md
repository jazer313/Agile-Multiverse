# Sprint Goal
#WIP 

Created during the [[Sprint Planning]] and the main part of the [[Sprint Backlog]]. The Sprint Goal is the _single objective_ for the [[Sprint]] (See [[WHY]]). A [[commitment]] by the [[Developers (Scrum)]]  [^1].

Provides flexibility in terms of the exact work (See [[WHAT]]) needed to achieve it. 

Creates coherence and [[focus]] to a same end-goal.

The [[Developers (Scrum)]] and [[Product Owner]] may collaborate to negotiate the [[scope]] of the [[Sprint Backlog]] _without affecting_ the Sprint Goal.
