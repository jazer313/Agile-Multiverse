# Increment of value
#WIP 

A concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal [^1]

Each Increment is _additive to all prior Increments_. All Increments work together. The Increment must be usable.

_Multiple_ Increments may be created and delivered to [[stakeholders]] within a [[Sprint]]. The sum of the Increments is presented at the [[Sprint Review]] thus supporting [[empiricism]]. The [[Sprint Review]] should **never be considered a gate** to releasing value.

Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the [[Definition of Done (Scrum)]].
