# Product Owner

_Accountable for maximizing the value of the product_ and effective [[Product Backlog]] management[^1], which includes:

- Developing and explicitly communicating the [[Product Goal]]
- Creating and _clearly_ communicating [[Product Backlog]] items
- Ordering [[Product Backlog]] items (Prioritization)
- Ensuring that the [[Product Backlog]] is _transparent, visible and **understood**_. (See: [[Scrum pillar of transparency]])

May delegate the responsibility to other (Still accountable).

The Product Owner is _one person, not a committee_. 

The Product Owner may represent the needs of many [[stakeholders]] in the (items and ordering of the) [[Product Backlog]].

The entire organization must respect the decisions of the Product Owner (See: [[Empowerment]]). These are visible in the content and ordering of the [[Product Backlog]], and through the inspectable [[Increment of value]] at the [[Sprint Review]].
