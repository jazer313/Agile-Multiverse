# Sprint Planning
#WIP 

Sprint Planning initiates the [[Sprint]]. Devising a plan of the work to be performed for the [[Sprint]] is created by **the entire [[Scrum Team]]** [^1]. They may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice or input (but only if they have value to add to the discussion).

The planning should consider their context, capacity, complexity, skills, tools, priority, [[technical debt]], past performance, [[Definition of Done (Scrum)]]... and/or anything the team learned in the last [[Sprint Retrospective]].

Sprint Planning is [[time-box]] to a maximum of **eight hours**.

The [[Sprint Backlog]] is the output of the Sprint planning, which consists on:
- The [[Sprint Goal]]
- The [[Product Backlog]] items selected for the [[Sprint]] ([[Scope]] of the [[Sprint]])
- The plan for delivering them

The [[Product Owner]] ensures that the team is prepared to discuss the most important [[Product Backlog]] items and how they map to the [[Product Goal]].

Sprint Planning must answer:

#### Why is this Sprint valuable?

_Define the [[Product Goal]]_

The [[Product Owner]] proposes _how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint_. 

Then the whole [[Scrum Team]] collaborates to define a [[Sprint Goal]] that communicates to the [[stakeholders]]: **Why** the work in the [[Sprint]] could add value to the users/customers (See [[Focus]] and [[Courage]]).

#### What can be Done this Sprint?
_Select the [[Product Backlog]] items_

Through discussion with the [[Product Owner]], **the [[Developers (Scrum)]]** select items from the [[Product Backlog]] to work in the current Sprint (See [[Commitment]]).

The [[Scrum Team]] may clarify/refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence.

#### How will the chosen work get done?
_Plan for delivering the selected items_

For each selected [[Product Backlog]] item, _the [[Developers (Scrum)]] plan the work/activities_ necessary to create an [[Increment of value]] that meets the [[Definition of Done (Scrum)]]. 

_How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers_. No one else tells them how to turn [[Product Backlog]] items into an [[Increment of value]] (See: [[Respect]] and [[Knowledge Work]]).
