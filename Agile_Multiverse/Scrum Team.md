# Scrum Team
#practice 

A [[cross-functional]], self-managed (see: [[Self management]]), empowered (see: [[Empowerment]]) team of people with _no sub-teams or hierarchies_. [^1]

A Scrum Team consists on:
- [[Developers (Scrum)]]
- _One_ [[Product Owner]]
- _One_ [[Scrum Master]]

The entire Scrum Team is _responsible for **all** product-related activities_. (e.g: [[stakeholders]] collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development... anything else that might be required.)

The entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a useful [[Increment of value]]  every [[Sprint]].
