# Burn-down chart
#WIP 

A simple method to monitor and display the progress of the work. Provide a visual representation of the _remaining effort for a given period of time_.

The _Y axis_ represents the **Remaining Work** (The units can be number of [[Product Backlog]] items, [[User Stories]], [[Story Points]], … Or any unit that reflects the [[scope]]) and the _X axis_ represents a **Period of Time** (By Hours, Days, Weeks…).

The Burndown chart can be used over time to calculate a teams [[velocity]].
