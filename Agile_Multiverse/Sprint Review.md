# Sprint Review


The [[Scrum Team]] presents the results of their work in the [Sprint] to key [[stakeholders]], progress toward the [[Product Goal]] is discussed [^1] ([[Openness]]).

The _second to last event_ of the [[Sprint]] and is [[time-box]] to a maximum of **four hours**.

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect ([[Scrum pillar of inspection]]) the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations ([[Scrum pillar of adaptation]]). Is a working session **not** _only a presentation_.

**The Sprint Review should _never_ be considered a gate to releasing an [[Increment of value]]** (See: [[Continuous delivery]])

Together [[Scrum Team]] and [[stakeholders]] review what has changed in their environment, and collaborate on what to do next. The [[Product Backlog]] may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities.
