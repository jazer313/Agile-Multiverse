# Daily Scrum
#WIP 

Is a 15-minute [[time-box]] event **for the [[Developers (Scrum)]]**[^1]. It focuses on progress toward the [[Sprint Goal]] ([[Focus]]) and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work ([[Self management]]).

The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to _inspect ([[Scrum pillar of inspection]]) progress toward the [[Sprint Goal]]_ and _adapt ([[Scrum pillar of adaptation]]) the [[Sprint Backlog]]_, adjusting the upcoming planned work. 

**If** the [[Product Owner]] and/or [[Scrum Master]] are _actively working on items_ in the [[Sprint Backlog]], they may participate.

[Previous versions of the Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf) popularized the use of _the three daily questions_ (What did I do yesterday?; What will I do today?; Do I see any impediments?); since the latest version the questions are omitted so not to create the wrong understanding that dailies _must_ be structured that way. The [[Developers (Scrum)]] can select whatever structure and techniques they want.

**The daily scrum is NOT a status meeting**, it's a practice to improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and eliminate the need for other ~~pointless~~ meetings.

The Daily Scrum is not/should not be the only time [[Developers (Scrum)]] are allowed to adapt or re-plan the rest of the work. They often meet throughout the day and actively collaborate (preferably with face-to-face conversations).
