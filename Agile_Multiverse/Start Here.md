# About this multiverse

Welcome to the bast multiverse of Agile... Welcome to my digital notebook.

Hi! Iâ€™m [Mau Vera](https://www.mauvera.co/). Youâ€™ve encountered my **agile** working notes, my personal knowledge vault. Theyâ€™re kind of strange, so some context might help.

When I started doing Agile, I realized that the practices, values, and principles weren't silos, they were connected... they relate, respond to, and inspire one another.

These notes have the goal to understand these invisible connections. Iâ€™m sharing them publicly as an experiment but are mostly written for myself.

# How to navigate
As mentioned, most of the topics are connected in many ways, so there is not a linear way to consume the information, itâ€™s more a _choose your own adventure_ kind of learning. So just __go down the rabbit hole__.

Unlike a traditional wiki, this particular vault holds _backlinks_, which are the other pages that reference the page you are on. Backlinks can be useful to find notes that reference the note you are on.

At the bottom of any page look for the section **LINKS TO THIS PAGE** and see the invisible connections between topics (Or if you are a more visual learner, you can always use the graph view at the right).

## Caveats
1. Just as an Agile [[product]], this new way to see Agile is not intended as a one-time-only [[project]], but as a continuous and evolving effort. Adding new information, and connections. _The multiverse will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is information left in the world_.
2. Essentially, these notes are **written for me, by me**. They reflect and contain my environment, context, bias, culture, interests, mental models, and filters. They are a restatement of the content and **should never be confused as verbatim/summary of the primary sources**. Sharing them here is in the interest of documenting my journey to understand the content. I am working with the garage door open to the world. If they add value to someone else from reading them, it's a bonus.
3. Credit where credit is due, I am standing on the shoulders of giants and I'll do my best to always link to the primary sources. If you want to learn any particular topic, I urge you to consult and support those resources instead.
4. This is not a comprehensive set of insights around any topic. This is not a framework or scaled practice. They are just a collection of ideas I found interesting at a particular moment, and you will find many missing notes still waiting to be created.

## Errors
If and when I make mistakes, you can contribute to this multiverse by [Opening an issue](https://github.com/mauvera94/Agile-Multiverse/issues) in Github

## Board
You can check out [my Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/k8kGahOo/agile-multiverse) and even vote on the upcoming topics. 

## Distributed versions
If you want to branch or even download the vault you can do it in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mauvera94/Agile-Multiverse) just follow the instructions in the documentation.

## Organization
These are the tags I'll be using to create some convention:
- #mindset notes that talk about the established set of attitudes and believes held by someone
- #values notes that talk about basic and fundamental beliefs that guide or motivate attitudes or actions
- #principles notes that talk about foundational behaviors or assumptions that stand alone
- #practice notes that talk about frameworks, methodologies, methods or activities

You'll also find notes tagged #WIP, which is how I remind myself that something is in progress or I have some mantainance work to do.
