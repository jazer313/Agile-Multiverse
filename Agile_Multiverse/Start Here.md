# About this multiverse

Welcome to the bast multiverse of Agile... Welcome to my digital notebook.

Hi! Iâ€™m [Mau Vera](https://www.mauvera.co/). Youâ€™ve encounter my **agile** working notes. Theyâ€™re kind of strange, so some context might help.

When I started doing Agile, I realized that the practices, values and principles weren't silos, they were connected... they relate, respond, inspire one another.

These notes have the goal to understand these invisible connections. Iâ€™m sharing them publicly as an experiment but are mostly written for myself

# How to navigate
As mentioned, most of the topics are connected in many ways, so there is not a linear way to consume the information, itâ€™s more a _choose your own adventure_ kind of learning. So just go at a topic and enjoy wherever your wind blows.

Unlike a traditional wiki, this particular vault holds _backlinks_, which are the other pages that reference the page you are on. At the bottom of any page look for the section **LINKS TO THIS PAGE** and see the invisible connections between topics (Or if you are a more visual learner, you can always use the graph view at the left).

## Index
Want to dive in head first? Maybe use this index:

## Caveats
1. Just as Agile products, this new way to see Agile is not intended as a one-time only project, but as a continuous and evolving effort. Adding new information, connections and maintaining the multiverse. _The multiverse will never be completed. It will continue to grow as long as there is information left in the world_.
2. Essentially, these notes are **written for me, by me**. They reflect my environment, context, bias, culture, interests, mental models, filters and **should not be confused as verbatim/summary of the primary sources** I'm sharing them here in the interest sharing knowledge. If they add value to someone else from reading them, it's a bonus.
3. They are not comprehensive set of insights  around any topic. They are just a collection of what I found in that moment.
4. Credit where credit is due, I am standing on the shoulders of giants and I'll do my best to always link to the primary sources I use. If you want to learn that topic, I urge you to use those resources.

## Organization
These are the tags I'll be using to create some convention:
- #mindset notes that talk about the established set of attitudes and believes held by someone
- #values notes that talk about basic and fundamental beliefs that guide or motivate attitudes or actions
- #principles notes that talk about foundational behaviors or assumptions that stand alone
- #practice notes that talk about frameworks, methodologies, methods or activities

You'll also find notes tagged #WIP, which is how I remind myself that something is in progress or I have some mantainance work to do.
