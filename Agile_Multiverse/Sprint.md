# Sprint [^1]
#practice 

A sprint (also known as _iteration_) is a [[time-box]]ed effort: A fixed length time for achieve a [[Sprint Goal]], of one month or less (Usually 2 weeks).

They start immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

All the work necessary to achieve the [[Product Goal]] happen inside Sprints, including (the four formal events for inspection ([[Scrum pillar of inspection]]) and adaptation ([[Scrum pillar of adaptation]])):

- [[Sprint Planning]]
- [[Daily Scrum|Daily Scrums]]
- [[Sprint Review]]
- [[Sprint Retrospective]]


During the Sprint:
- No changes are made that would endanger the [[Sprint Goal]]
- Quality does not decrease
- The [[Product Backlog]] is refined as needed
- [[Scope]] ([[Sprint Backlog]]) may be clarified and renegotiated with the [[Product Owner]] as more is learned (No adding new items in the middle of the sprint)


The smaller time frame of Sprints aides on: 
- The [[Sprint Goal]] stay valid 
- Decrease [[complexity]]
- Mitigate [[risk]]
- Generate more learning cycles
- Limit [[risk]] of cost and effort 

Each Sprint may be considered a short _complete_ [[project]] (Unlike [[traditional projects]], Sprints have a fixed [[time]] and [[cost]], while the [[scope]] is variable). From planning to deployment, under no circumstances sprints should be consider as _[[project]] phases_, and have multiple sprints to do different activities.

Various practices exist to forecast progress (these do not replace the importance of [[empiricism]]), like:
- [[Burn-down chart]]
- [[Burn-up chart]]
- [[Cumulative flow diagram]]

The [[Product Owner]] could cancel a Sprint if the [[Sprint Goal]] becomes obsolete.
