# Product Backlog
#WIP 

An emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the [[product]]. [^1]

The _single source_ of work undertaken by the [[Scrum Team]].

The Product backlog items are not limited to [[features]] only, but any kind of work (e.g. [[bugs]], [[risks]], [[technical debt]], documentation...).

_Refining_ the Product Backlog (add details, such as a description, order, and size (The [[Developers (Scrum)]] who will be doing the work are responsible for the [[sizing]]) ...) is an ongoing activity. Here, items are broken down and further are defined into smaller more precise.

Product Backlog items that can be Done (Bring to [[Definition of Done (Scrum)]]) by the [[Scrum Team]] within one [[Sprint]] are deemed ready for selection (See [[Definition of Ready]]) in the [[Sprint Planning]] event.
