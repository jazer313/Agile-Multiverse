# Sprint 0

> [!warning] Not Agile
> The concept of Sprint 0 is a misrepresentation of an Agile Practice

A Sprint 0 is the bastardization of a [[Sprint]] done "before" the first formal [[Sprint]] in [[Scrum]], usually for [[Planning Phase|planning]] and [[Initiating Phase|initiating]] activities (As [[traditional projects]] do before the [[Execution Phase]]).

Some activities that are taken during this abomination are (for example):
- Create a vision
- A rough [[product backlog]]
- An [[estimation]] of a product [[release]] 

The concept distorts the true reasons to do a [[Sprint]]: An [[Sprint]] **always** delivers an [[Increment of value]]. Is where ideas are turned into value.

A _Sprint 0_ doesn't generate an [[Increment of value]] or goes after a [[Sprint Goal]], thus is just [[waste]].
