# Definition of Done (DoD)
#WIP 

A formal description of the state of the [[Increment of value]] when it meets the quality measures necessary for the item [^1].
 
The Definition of Done creates transparency ([[Scrum pillar of transparency]]) by providing everyone a shared understanding of what quality of work is needed to create an [[Increment of value]]. 

If a [[Product Backlog]] item does not meet the Definition of Done, it:
- Cannot be released
- Cannot be presented at the [[Sprint Review ]]
- Returns to the [[Product Backlog]] to be considered on the future.  

All the [[Developers (Scrum)]] working in a product define and follow the same Definition of Done, and should (as minimum) include any standard quality requirements an organization  has.
