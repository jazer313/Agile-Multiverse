# Scrum artifacts
#WIP 

Represent work or value [^1].

Designed to maximize transparency ([[Scrum pillar of transparency]]).

Each artifact contains a commitment:

- For the [[Product Backlog]] it is the [[Product Goal]].
- For the [[Sprint Backlog]] it is the [[Sprint Goal]].
- For the [[Increment of value]] it is the [[Definition of Done (Scrum)]].

The commitments reinforce [[empiricism]] and the [[Scrum values]].
