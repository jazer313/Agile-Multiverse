# Refining the Product Backlog
#WIP 

The ongoing activity of adding details to the [[Product Backlog]] items. 

Examples of the details added are (not limited to):
- Description
- Prioritized order
- Size (The [[Developers (Scrum)]] who will be doing the work are responsible for the [[sizing]]).

Also items are broken down and further defined into smaller more precise items.

Refactoring is known as _[[Grooming]]_ in some publications, contexts and organizations. There is an intent to move from the verb _grooming_ to _refactoring_, because the former one has a sexual connotation[^1].
