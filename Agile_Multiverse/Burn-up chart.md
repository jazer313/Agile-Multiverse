# Burn-up chart
#WIP 

A simple method to monitor and display the progress of the work. Provide a visual representation of the _remaining effort for a given period of time_.

Is like a [[Burn-down chart]] but you start with all the work on top of the Y axis, instead of the bottom. And you work you way down to zero.
