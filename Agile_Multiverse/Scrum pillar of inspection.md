# Scrum pillar of inspection

The [[Scrum artifacts]] must be checked frequently and carefully to detect potentially variances or problems.[^1]

Inspection is enabled by maintaining a cadence in the shape of the [[Scrum events]].

Only what has already happened may be used for forward-looking decision making.

Inspection enables [[Scrum pillar of adaptation]].
