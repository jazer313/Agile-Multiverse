# Scrum pillar of adaptation

Processes and/or the produced work must be adjusted as soon as possible to minimize further deviation from outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable.[^1]

A [[Scrum Team]] is **expected** to _readjust_ the moment it learns anything new through [[Scrum pillar of inspection]].

[[Empowerment]] and [[Self management]] make adaptation easier.
