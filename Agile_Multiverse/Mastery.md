# Mastery

Becoming better at something that matters [^1].

Mastery has [[Flow]] at its core, where the challenge we face matches our abilities, because it's not too hard and not too easy, it keeps us engaged.

Mastery follows:
- Is a mindset: See ones abilities as infinite (See: [[Growth mindset]])
- Is painful: Demands effort, grit, deliberate practice and [[continuous improvement]].
- Is imposible to _fully_ realize (See: [[Infinite game]])
